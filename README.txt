[View plugin Demo](https://yummywp.com/plugin/smart-search/).

Smart WooCommerce Search provides efficient search through your website.

It is fast, and easy to use plugin for WooCommerce based websites with a huge amount of items.

The plugin could be easily integrated into the default WooCommerce Product Search widget in one click by just checking this option in the Smart Search Settings.

You can manage a lot of settings provided by the plugin to customize its appearance by selecting what fields to display and changing styling options.

It’s pretty easy to select required fields to be used for the search in the plugin settings.

The main purpose of Smart plugin is to improve the user search experience for any WordPress based website.

Also Smart Search could be integrated into default WordPress search widget to be used on any website, and by doing that the plugin expands the default search widget and overwrite the default WordPress search result.

Give it a try and enjoy:)
