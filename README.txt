With this Instant **Ajax** WooCommerce **search plugin**, your customers will be able to find any product on your online store. Just enter the required keyword and the plugin will start viewing all WooCommerce products one by one.

This plugin is indispensable for sites with a large number of product items.

You can completely customize your **smart search**. In addition, the plugin integrates seamlessly into the **WooCommerce Product Search** widget.

You have the opportunity to create your Smart Search widget and paste it on any of the pages of the site (to do this, use the "Code" widget in **DIVI**) using a shortcode [smart_search id = "1 ″]. You can also place it on the sidebar using the Smart Search widget. Replace the default theme search using a shortcode.

An important advantage is that WooCommerce Search is compatible with **Elementor** (you can find the required widget in the list of Elementor widgets). It is also compatible with the **WPBakery Page Builder** plugin.

Also you can replace default **Avada** search with a smart search in an easy way.

Give it a try and enjoy:)
