Smart Search allows you to search any content type on a website, including WooCommerce products.

== Description ==

= Smart Search plugin is smart, fast, and easy to use. =

Smart Search provides efficient search through your website.

It is fast, and easy to use plugin for WooCommerce based websites with a huge amount of items.

The plugin could be easily integrated into the default WooCommerce Product Search widget in one click by just checking this option in the Smart Search Settings.

You can manage the amount of the characters to be used for search process and the amount of the search results to be displayed in the plugin settings.

It’s pretty easy to select required fields to be used for the search in the plugin settings.

The main purpose of Smart plugin is to improve the user search experience for any WordPress based website.

Also Smart Search could be integrated into default WordPress search widget to be used on any website, and by doing that the plugin expands the default search widget and overwrite the default WordPress search result.
